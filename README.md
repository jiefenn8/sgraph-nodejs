## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the prerequisties and deployment notes below on how to deploy the project on a live environment.

### Prerequisites

 * Make sure to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

 * Have a Neo4J database with a graph generated by a CONVERT component or  containing the following:

	 * Neo4J Graph containing nodes with type: 	
		 * :Resource  	
		 * bound to other 
		 * :Resource
		 *  by a relationship identified by a TYPE

	* :Resource must have the property:
		*  	name - contains the value of that node


What the Neo4J Graph should look like:

### Running locally

Clone the repository using terminal or cmd
```
cd <install directory of choice>
git clone https://github.com/jiefenn8/sgraph-nodejs.git
```

Edit the driver address to your Neo4J server in neo4j.js
```
var  driver  =  neo4j.driver(
	"bolt://<your neo4j host address>",
	neo4j.auth.basic("<login>", "<password>)
);
```

Back to terminal or cmd
```
cd sgraph-nodejs
npm install
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on default [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) or through a different port if npm is configured in your system.
